## Quick start

Make sure you have docker and docker-compose. To run the application, use the following command
in a terminal window:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

There are two user accounts present to demonstrate the different levels of access to the endpoints
in the API and the different authorization exceptions:

- User - user:Qwerty1!
- Admin - admin:Qwerty1!

### JSON Web Token

> JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard RFC 7519 method for representing claims securely
between two parties. For more info, check out https://jwt.io/

> Token authentication is a more modern approach and is designed solve problems session IDs stored
server-side canâ€™t. Using tokens in place of session IDs can lower your server load, streamline
permission management, and provide better tools for supporting a distributed or cloud-based
infrastructure.
