# Angular Spring Boot JWT Starter

This sub-project is the backend server portion of the project.

## Run the Application

To run the application, use the following command in a terminal window:

```

The app will be running on port 8080. There are two built-in user accounts to demonstrate the
differing levels of access to the endpoints:

- User - user:Qwerty1!
- Admin - admin:Qwerty1!
